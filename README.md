Edge detection CV using python


Edge detection is an image-processing technique that is used to identify the boundaries (edges) of objects or regions within an image.
Edges are among the most important features associated with images.
We know the underlying structure of an image through its edges.
Computer vision processing pipelines, therefore, extensively use edge detection in applications.
